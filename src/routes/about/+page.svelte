				<p>
					Opus XX exists to elevate, empower, and amplify the voices of women composers — past,
					present, and future.
				</p>

				<p>
					We believe classical music becomes richer and more relevant when it reflects the full
					diversity of its creators. Opus XX combines research, artistry, and cutting-edge
					technology to make it easier for programmers, musicians, and institutions to discover and
					include works by women composers in their concerts.
				</p>

				<p>
					By weaving inclusivity, accessibility, and historical justice into our tools, we're
					building a bridge between musical heritage and innovation — helping reshape how audiences
					and professionals engage with the repertoire. Our goal is simple: to make discovering
					female composers intuitive, inspiring, and impactful.
				</p>

				<h2 class="mb-4 mt-12 font-zwo text-3xl font-bold">The Opus XX Generator</h2>

				<p>
					Meet the Opus XX Generator — an intelligent concert programming assistant designed to
					close the gender gap in classical music programming.
				</p>

				<p>
					Developed with the support of LiveMX and co-funded by the European Union, the Generator
					offers an intuitive AI interface that recommends works by women composers to complement
					existing concert programs.
				</p>

				<p>
					Thanks to a deep network of connected databases co-developed with Playstate.Projects, the
					Generator provides tailored recommendations for individual musicians, ensembles, and major
					institutions — helping everyone, from programmers to performers, create more balanced and
					forward-looking concerts.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-12">
					The Opus XX Generator isn't just a tool — it's a movement toward a more inclusive and
					vibrant musical landscape in Europe.
